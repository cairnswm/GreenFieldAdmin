# GreenFieldAdmin
Simple React admin template using Bootstrap. Minimal number of npm packages used.

# State
Where possible data values are all stored in a context store and used to populate the screen. This means that just updating the context store will allow all screens to show the data properly. (Most templates hard code data within the HTML which makes it more difficult to modify to display data)

# Done
Basic Layout
Sidebar
Profile and messages popups 
React Router

# ToDo
Login system
Mail - view mail detail, send mail, delete mail
- fix up layout, row/col structure not working for me
Fetch - fetch data (from PHP backend)

# NPM Libraries Used
react
react-router
font-awesome (free)

# Other files
ColorPaletee - just come codes for colors for the demo palette
class Files - a step by step walk through of how components were added - might become a tutorial series sometime in the future
