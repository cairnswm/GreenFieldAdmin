# Green Field Admin

Admin page layout using React-Bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

Pages are written as for an actual project using state and in some cases API calls to update state. The idea here is that the structure is usable for projects, unlike other HTML templates that are static pages, even the React versions of most admin templates only wrap the static html instead of being converted to a well structured React layout.

## 5 Pages

- Contact Page
- Contact Details
- Blog (using api data from jasonplaceholder)
- Live Weather (live api data from OpenWeatherMap)
- Invoice

## Blog 

Blog page uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com for Users, Posts and Comments. State is managed within the page and provides an interactive experience by choosing a person, choosing a post and viewing the posts and comments.

## Weather

Change the API for the weather as the API being used is a free key and has limited calls allowed.

## Custom Components

Uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap and https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-text
